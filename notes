# Future Improvements
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Dynamic Logger Configurations: Allow more dynamic configurations, such as setting
#    log levels based on the environment.
# 2. Enhanced Error Notifications: Integrate with notification services like Slack or
#    email for error alerts.
# 3. Task Retry Mechanism: Include task retry functionality with exponential backoff.
# 4. Extensible Scheduler Options: Enable more complex scheduling options like intervals
#    and custom triggers.
# 5. Memory and Performance Tracking: Integrate memory and performance tracking,
#    particularly for long-running tasks.
# 6. Persistent Task Management: Add functionality to save and retrieve task state for
#    fault tolerance.
# 7. Plugin Health Check: Add a validation process to verify each pluginâ€™s availability before execution.
# 8. AI-based Fallback Option: If Mistral fails, enable a fallback to another AI model or simpler resolution mechanism.
# 9. Multi-Error Diagnosis: Enhance AI diagnostics to handle multi-layered errors by iterating through each error in a stack trace.
# 10. Persistent Resolution History: Maintain a history of resolutions that the agent can reference for similar issues.
# 11. User Decision Caching: Allow user responses to be stored for future automated decisions on similar edge cases.
# 12. Asynchronous Task Execution: Refactor task execution methods to be asynchronous for improved performance and scalability.
# 13. Enhanced Plugin Interface: Define a more comprehensive plugin interface, possibly using abstract base classes, to ensure consistency across plugins.
# 14. Security Enhancements: Implement security measures for plugin execution to prevent malicious code execution.
# 15. Comprehensive Unit Testing: Develop unit tests for each component to ensure reliability and facilitate future development.
